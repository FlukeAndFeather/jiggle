Description: The jiggle package estimates forward speed of an animal from the 
    amplitude of accelerometer "jiggle". It uses an in situ calibration to 
    regress periods of known speed on the magnitude of the jiggle, which can be 
    used to predict speed throughout the deployment. See Cade et al. 2018 for 
    more details.
