#' jiggle: Estimating speed from accelerometer jiggle
#'
#' The jiggle package estimates forward speed of an animal from the amplitude
#'   of accelerometer "jiggle". It uses an in situ calibration to regress
#'   periods of known speed on the magnitude of the jiggle, which can be used
#'   to predict speed throughout the deployment. See Cade et al. 2018 for more
#'   details.
